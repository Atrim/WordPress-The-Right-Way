# Multisite

## Grabbing Data From Another Blog in a Network

Getting data from another blog on the same multisite install can be done. Some people use SQL commands to do this, but this can be slow, and error prone.

Although it's an inherently expensive operation, you can make use of `switch_to_blog` and `restore_current_blog` to make it easier, while using the standard WordPress APIs.

```php
switch_to_blog( $blog_id );
// Do something
restore_current_blog();
```

`restore_current_blog` undos the last call to `switch_to_blog`, but only by one step, the calls are not nestable, so always call `restore_current_blog` before calling `switch_to_blog` again.

## Listing Blogs in a Network

Doable but doesn't scale for big networks and is expensive.

But is it possible since version 3.7 of WordPress with `wp_get_sites( $args )`. The function accept a list of arguments to the parameter `$args`. See the [codex to this function](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_sites) of WordPress for details.
The function have check for large networks and get no result, a empty array, if the network is large. By default the check  `wp_is_large_network()` returns `TRUE` if there are 10,000 or more sites in your network. This can be filtered using the `wp_is_large_network` filter.


## Domain Mapping

Domain mapping allows a blog on a multisite install to serve from any domain name. This way a blog does not have to be a subdirectory of the main install, or a subdomain. The WordPress Default supports Domain Mapping without Alias. Add the Domain in the blog-settings to the blog of the Network administration area.

Often is it helpful - but not necessary, to set the `COOKIE_DOMAIN` constant to an empty string in your `wp-config.php`:

 `define('COOKIE_DOMAIN', '');`

Otherwise WordPress will always set it to your networkâ€™s `$current_site->domain`, which could cause issues in some situations.

WordPress Core hopes to provide Domain Alias Mapping in the future, but until then you can make use of one of the following plugins:

 * [Mercator - WordPress multisite domain mapping for the modern era.](https://github.com/humanmade/Mercator)
 * [WordPress MU Domain Mapping - Map any blog/site on a WordPressMU or WordPress 3.X network to an external domain.](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/)
