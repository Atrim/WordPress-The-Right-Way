# Tools

Debugging tools fall into two categories:

 - Tools to diagnose issues when they arise and reveal problems
 - Tools that prevent mistakes and errors from ever happening to begin with

The age old adage still applies: **prevention is better than cure**

## Debugging Tools / Plugins

Installing the plugin [Developer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/developer/) from the WordPress repository will give you quick access to a broad range of debugging tools. The following debugging plugins are quite useful:
 - [Log Deprecated Notices](http://wordpress.org/plugins/developer) Logs usage of deprecated functions.
 - [Debug Bar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar) Provides an interface for debugging PHP Notices/Warnings/Errors, reviewing SQL Queries, analysing caching behaviour and much more. It's also extendable with plugins.
 - [Debug Console](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar-console/) The Debug Console for example is really useful.
 - [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/) View debugging and performance information on database queries, hooks, conditionals, HTTP requests, redirects and more.

### Xdebug
The [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/index.php) PHP Extension allows for enhanced debugging, function and method tracing, and profiling of PHP applications.
