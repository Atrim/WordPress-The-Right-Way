# Getting Started

## Basic PHP

It's assumed that you have a basic knowledge of PHP. This will include a knowledge of:

 - functions
 - arrays
 - variables
 - loops and conditionals
 - classes and objects
 - class inheritance
 - polymorphism
 - POST and GET
 - variable scope

If you don't have a good grasp of those concepts, you should make sure you have a firm understanding before continuing.

It's also assumed you have a code editor that has PHP syntax highlighting, although these will be beneficial:

 - Auto Indenting
 - Auto-completion
 - Brace matching
 - Syntax checking
